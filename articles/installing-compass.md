# Installing Compass

Before installing Compass, make sure you have permissions to install new apps in your Slack team. Depending on your Slack team's permissions, you may need to be an admin to install Compass.

Once you're sure you have permissions, visit https://compasshq.com and click on "Add to Slack". You'll be taken to this page:

To make sure you're authorizing Compass for the correct Slack workspace, check the workspace name, listed in the dropdown in the upper right corner. If you need to switch teams, you can use that same dropdown. To finish this step, click on the green "Authorize" button.

You'll then be taken to the final installation page.

If this is your first time installing Compass, review our Terms & Conditions, and click the **Continue** button if they're acceptable.

You can also click "Advanced Install" if you're ready to adjust who is able to access Compass, and whether to sync channel metadata. Or, you can always customize these settings later on from inside the app.
