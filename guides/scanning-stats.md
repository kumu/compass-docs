# Scanning stats

While the [leaderboards](/guides/understanding-leaderboards.html) are great for focused, network-specific stats, sometimes you need more basic analytics.

The two places to get those numbers are the **Overview** panel and the **Stats** panel.

The Overview panel is open by default when you open Compass, but you can get back to it at any time by click the Compass logo in the top left of the interface.

You can open the Stats panel by clicking the bar chart icon <i class="fa fa-charts-bar">  </i> a little below the Compass logo.

The Overview panel shows total messages, mentions, and percent of communication taking place in public. Then, it shows a visualization of message sentiment over time (green is positive sentiment, red is negative).

Check out [the full guide on sentiment analysis](/guides/sentiment-analysis.html) to learn more about how Compass analyzes sentiment.

Below the sentiment-over-time chart, the Overview panel shows a list of the most active people and most active channels.

The Stats panel is split up into three sections: People, Channels, and Fields. The People and Channels sections contain some basic stats for those entities, and the Fields section shows stats for any [fields](/guides/fields.html) you've added into Compass.
