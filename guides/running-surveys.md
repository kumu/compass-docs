# Running surveys

Messages and @mentions offer great insight into your team's real structure, but they don't always tell the whole story.

Not all messages represent the same kind of relationship! A pair of people might casually chat very often, or @mention each other as they tackle a bunch of small tasks together.

But imagine you were able to connect people based on who they turn to for advice when they're stuck on a difficult problem. Those messages might only get sent on rare occasions, but they represent a pretty strong relationship between two people.

**Surveys** are a powerful tool when it comes to capturing those deeper relationships that messages and @mentions don't always emphasize. Surveys are also perfect for more generic purposes, like getting feedback on a product idea, or asking people what skill they're most proud of.

To get started with surveys, click on the chat bubble icon <i class="fa fa-comment">  </i> to open the survey panel.

The survey panel will show a list of any questions you've asked in the past, and you can click the **Add Survey** button at the top to create a new one. In a new survey, you can choose an answer type:
- **Teammate**: Respondents can select somebody else in the workspace as their answer. You can opt to let people select more than one other person in their answer.
- **Custom list**: Define your own choices (e.g. skills), and decide whether people can pick one or many when they answer.
- **Free text**: Respondents can type anything they want when they answer.

Then, click the **Select respondents** button at the bottom of the panel to determine exactly who receives the survey question from Compass.

Once you start receiving responses, you can select the question from your list, and Compass will re-draw the map based on people's responses.

If the survey question's possible answers are other people in the workspace, Compass will connect people to people based on their responses. For example, the question "Who did you most recently ask for advice?" would offer other workspace members as the possible answers, and Compass would connect people based on their responses.

If the survey question's possible answers are more generic, Compass will connect people to their responses. For example, if you send a survey asking "What skill are you most proud of?" and offer a list of skills, Compass will connect people to the skill(s) they chose.
